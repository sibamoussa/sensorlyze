This will not work if you have not entered concentration values. The data is automatically exported into an excel sheet named \"Results\" in the same working directory as the software files. If you would like to export points only and no concentrations, enter a range of indices instead of concentrations. Go to Calibrations: Clicking on Go to Calibrations will move the current tab to the next tab Analytics-Calibration Statistics where the regression parameters for the calibrations are shown. Tab 3: Analytics- Calibration Statistics Plot Calibration: Clicking on plot calibration will show a plot of the calibration along with the following regression parameters: - R\u00b2, Slope, Intercept, LOD , and LOQ * LOD is the limit of detection, defined as 3 times the standard deviation of the blank signal divided by the slope of the regression line. * LOQ is the limit of quantification, defined as 10 times the standard deviation of the blank signal divided by the slope of the regression line. For more information on detection limits, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit] Note: Values will show to 3 decimal places. If you get a value of 0, exporting the data will show you the real value. Save Calibration Plot: Clicking on save calibration will allow you to save the plot in the directory of your choice. Current supported file formats for saving graphics are: *.jpg and *.tiff file formats Export Calibration Data: Clicking on export calibration data will automatically save the calibration data in an excel file named Calibration located in the same working directory as the software. The data exported data will consist of two tables in the same sheet: - Table 1: Columns with the 1) concentration, 2) average currents from all the data files for each concentration , 3) standard deviation for the currents used to calculate the mean current , standard error of the mean (SEM) for each mean current value - Table 2: Calibration regression statistics [ R\u00b2, Intercept, Slope, LOD, and LOQ] Plot Normalized Calibration: Clicking on plot normalized calibration will show a plot of the normalized calibration along with the following regression parameters: - R\u00b2, Slope, Intercept, LOD , and LOQ * * LOD is the limit of detection, defined as 3 times the standard deviation of the blank signal divided by the slope of the regression line. ** LOQ is the limit of quantification, defined as 10 times the standard deviation of the blank signal divided by the slope of the regression line. For more information on detection limits, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit] Notes: - Values will show to 3 decimal places. If you get a value of 0, exporting the data will show you the real value. - Normalized currents are background signal subtracted current values. Save Normalized Calibration Plot: Clicking on save normalized calibration will allow you to save the plot in the directory of your choice. Current supported file formats for saving graphics are: *.jpg and *.tiff file formats Export Normalized Calibration Data: Clicking on export normalized calibration data will automatically save the calibration data in an excel file named Normalized Calibration located in the same working directory as the software. The data exported data will consist of two tables in the same sheet: - Table 1: Columns with the 1) concentration, 2) background subtracted average currents (normalized average currents) from all the data files for each concentration , 3) standard deviation of the normalized currents used to calculate the mean current , standard error of the mean (SEM) for each normalized mean current value - Table 2: Calibration regression statistics [ R\u00b2, Intercept, Slope, LOD, LOQ, Standard Deviation of the Blank **] For each set of currents obtained for a single data file, the currents are normalized by subtracting the background current from each current value. Once this has been completed for each file, the mean current for each concentration from the different files is calculated and displayed in the table. The standard deviation for the baseline (zero) concentration will always be zero. The standard error of the mean for the baseline (zero) concentration will always be zero. *** For LOD and LOQ calculations, the the standard deviation of the blank used is the standard deviation of the unnormalized current readings for the blank signals.

Plot File: Current-time data within the selected file will be plotted. Please input the sampling range over which the values are to be averaged (seconds): This option will allow you to enter a sampling range (in seconds) over which the current data is averaged. For example, if you would like to get the mean current for a 30 second sampling frequency, enter 30 into the textbox. The current data over a range of 30s will be extracted from the plot each time the blue bar is moved. These values will be averaged over time range to provide a mean current value. Done: When you have entered a value to change the sampling range, click on done A blue bar will appear on the plot. This blue bar can be moved to different regions of the data so that the data over the length of the bar is averaged and saved each time it is moved. Apply Noise Reduction Filter: Checking the box will apply the noise reduction filter. The data is filtered using a first-degree polynomial Savitzky-Golay filter. The Savitzky-Golay filter uses convolution-based filtering, i.e. fitting sub-sets of data points with a low degree polynomial using linear least squares. Unchecking the box will remove the noise filtered data and the original data will reappear. If you select points from the noise filtered plot, the points exported will not contain the original raw data. Instead, for the specific file, the mean currents from the noise filtered data are presented. Done Point Selection: When you have completed selecting all regions of interest in the plot, click on done point selection Export Selected Points: Clicking on export selected points will export the following to an excel file called Quant_Selected_Points : Table 1 [Time Points(first,last)]: A row with range of time points for each selection made in the data file (i.e. for each time the blue bar was dragged from one region to another). Only the first and last time point for each selected region are recorded. A row above with the corresponding point indices is also included. Table 2 [Current Values(first,last)]) : A row with first and last current reading collected from the range of time points for each selection made in the data file (i.e. for each time the blue bar was dragged from one region to another). Only the first and last time current reading for each selected region are recorded. A row above with the corresponding point indices is also included. Table 3 [Mean Currents (A)]: A row with the mean current from the average of current values across the range of time points for each selection made in the data file. (i.e. if the length of the blue bar was 30s, the first index would include the average of currents measured for 30s corresponding to the first region the blue bar was moved to). A row above with the corresponding point indices is also included. Notes: - All indexing begins at zero. - The data is automatically exported into an excel sheet named `Quant_Selected_Points` in the same working directory as the software files. Clear Selections : Clicking on clear selections will remove the blue bar and allow you to select a different sampling range and a new set of points to be exported. Tab 3: Analytics- Analyte Quantification Please input the regression line slope: Input the slope of the regression line.

Once this has been completed for each file, the mean current for each concentration from the different files is calculated and displayed in the table. The standard deviation for the baseline (zero) concentration will always be zero. The standard error of the mean for the baseline (zero) concentration will always be zero. *** For LOD and LOQ calculations, the the standard deviation of the blank used is the standard deviation of the unnormalized current readings for the blank signals.","title":"Multiple Sensor Calibration"},{"location":"manual/#quantification","text":"This window is split into three main tabs. To go through the data analysis follow the steps outlined for each tab: Tab 1: Visualize Data Import a data file to visualize: To import, select the file in the directory of choice. Select the Manufacturer and file type: The import file option currently supports files from the following manufacturers: HEKA, Biologic, CH Instruments, Excel Select the desired file type to proceed. Plot File: Current-time data within the selected file will be plotted. Save Plot: The plot will be saved in the directory of your choice. Current supported file formats for saving graphics are: *.jpg and *.tiff file formats Clear Plot: Data from the most currently plotted file will be cleared from the window. Clicking on plot file will cause the data to reappear. Tab 2: Analytics- Point Selection Import a data file to visualize: To import, select the file in the directory of choice. Select the Manufacturer and file type: The import file option currently supports files from the following manufacturers: HEKA, Biologic, CH Instruments, Excel Select the desired file type to proceed. Plot File: Current-time data within the selected file will be plotted. Please input the sampling range over which the values are to be averaged (seconds): This option will allow you to enter a sampling range (in seconds) over which the current data is averaged. For example, if you would like to get the mean current for a 30 second sampling frequency, enter 30 into the textbox. The current data over a range of 30s will be extracted from the plot each time the blue bar is moved. These values will be averaged over time range to provide a mean current value. Done: When you have entered a value to change the sampling range, click on done A blue bar will appear on the plot. This blue bar can be moved to different regions of the data so that the data over the length of the bar is averaged and saved each time it is moved. Apply Noise Reduction Filter: Checking the box will apply the noise reduction filter. The data is filtered using a first-degree polynomial Savitzky-Golay filter. The Savitzky-Golay filter uses convolution-based filtering, i.e. fitting sub-sets of data points with a low degree polynomial using linear least squares. Unchecking the box will remove the noise filtered data and the original data will reappear. If you select points from the noise filtered plot, the points exported will not contain the original raw data. Instead, for the specific file, the mean currents from the noise filtered data are presented. Done Point Selection: When you have completed selecting all regions of interest in the plot, click on done point selection Export Selected Points: Clicking on export selected points will export the following to an excel file called Quant_Selected_Points : Table 1 [Time Points(first,last)]: A row with range of time points for each selection made in the data file (i.e. for each time the blue bar was dragged from one region to another). Only the first and last time point for each selected region are recorded. A row above with the corresponding point indices is also included. Table 2 [Current Values(first,last)]) : A row with first and last current reading collected from the range of time points for each selection made in the data file (i.e. for each time the blue bar was dragged from one region to another). Only the first and last time current reading for each selected region are recorded. A row above with the corresponding point indices is also included. Table 3 [Mean Currents (A)]: A row with the mean current from the average of current values across the range of time points for each selection made in the data file. (i.e. if the length of the blue bar was 30s, the first index would include the average of currents measured for 30s corresponding to the first region the blue bar was moved to). A row above with the corresponding point indices is also included. Notes: - All indexing begins at zero. - The data is automatically exported into an excel sheet named `Quant_Selected_Points` in the same working directory as the software files. Clear Selections : Clicking on clear selections will remove the blue bar and allow you to select a different sampling range and a new set of points to be exported. Tab 3: Analytics- Analyte Quantification Please input the regression line slope: Input the slope of the regression line. This could be a slope obtained through earlier analysis using the Analytics- Point Selection tab. Please input the regression line intercept: Input the intercept for the same regression line as the one used for the slope input. Please input the current value: Input the current reading you have. Make sure that the calibration regression line parameters correspond to the same sensor used for experimental measurements. Done: Once you have completed all fields in the textboxes above this button, click on Done. Clicking on done will add the entered values into the table displayed on the window. Calculate concentration: After clicking on done, click on calculate concentration to calculate analyte concentration from the current reading and the regression parameters. The calculated concentration will appear in the concentration row in the table. Steps 1-5 can be repeated multiple times, with either the same regression parameters or varying regression parameters, to calculate the concentration for multiple sensor readings from the current values. Currently, the table can hold up to 12 measurements/readings. Export table: Clicking on export table will allow you to export the table to an excel file. The file can be named and saved in the directory of your choice as a .xslx file. Clear table: Clicking on clear table will clear all tabular values. You can re-populate the table by inserting new values into the textboxes in the window.","title":"Quantification"},{"location":"manual/#data-visualization","text":"This window consists of solely one tab.
