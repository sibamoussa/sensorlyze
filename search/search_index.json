Getting Started: Installing Sensorlyze Two options are available for running Sensorlyze: A standalone executable file The open-source python code for the software Both options are available through https://github.com/sibamoussa/Sensorlyze_Software Running the executable file The .exe file is available for downloading. This version is currently only windows compatible. Running the open-source python code To run the python script, download the gui_sensorlyze.py file and supporting .py files. Make sure that the supporting files are in the same folder as\\the main script. To prompt the GUI, run gui_sensorlyze.py. The following packages are required to run the script: * numpy * pandas * scipy * scikit * matplotlib * pyqt * sklearn 2. Using Sensorlyze : Start and Experiment Selection Once the software is prompted to run either by running the source code or by clicking on the icon of the .exe file, a window will appear, prompting you to start or exit Sensorlyze. Sensorlyze contains four modules, defined as experiments. Selecting start will prompt a new window [ select experiment ] to open. Click on the grey box to see a list of options. To perform the correct analysis, you can navigate through the options and select the option which matches best with your analysis needs: Single sensor calibration - Analyze chronoamperometric data corresponding to a single sensor/file. Multiple sensor calibration - Analyze chronoamperometric data corresponding to multiple sensors/files. Quantification - Select and extract data from regions of interest and quantify concentrations from regression parameters. Data Visualization - Visualize multiple data files and export them into a single graphic. Acceptable File Formats The import file functionality currently supports the following file types: *.asc # HEKA file format. *.txt # Biologic file format *.txt # CH Instruments file format ** *.xslx # Excel file format ** **These file formats are not supported by the Data Visualization analysis option* 3. Analysis Options Single Sensor Calibration This window is split into two main tabs. To go through the data analysis follow the steps outlined for each tab: Tab 1: Visualize Data 1. Import a data file to visualize: To import, select the file in the directory of choice. 2. Select the Manufacturer and file type: The import file option currently supports files from the following manufacturers: HEKA, Biologic, CH Instruments, Excel Select the desired file type to proceed. 3. Plot File: Current-time data within the selected file will be plotted. 4. Clear Plot: Plotted data will be cleared from the window. Clicking on plot file will cause the data to reappear. Alternatively, a new data file may be imported using the steps outlined earlier and plotted. 5. Save Plot: The plot will be saved in the directory of your choice. Current supported file formats for saving graphics are: *.jpg and *.tiff file formats Tab 2: Single Sensor Analytics 1. Import data file of choice 2. Select manufacturer and file type 3. Plot file 4.
